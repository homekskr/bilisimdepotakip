-- FIX: Push Subscriptions RLS Policies
-- ==========================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own subscriptions" ON public.push_subscriptions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own subscriptions" ON public.push_subscriptions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own subscriptions" ON public.push_subscriptions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own subscriptions" ON public.push_subscriptions;

-- Recreate with correct policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own subscriptions"
ON public.push_subscriptions FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own subscriptions"
ON public.push_subscriptions FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own subscriptions"
ON public.push_subscriptions FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own subscriptions"
ON public.push_subscriptions FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.push_subscriptions TO authenticated;
